Using draw.io diagrams in GitHub:

![Test image](https://github.com/alderg/sandbox/raw/master/test.png)

<a href="http://www.alderg.com/github.html?repo=sandbox&path=test.png" target="_blank">Edit</a> | <a href="https://www.draw.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Falderg%2Fsandbox%2Fmaster%2Ftest.png" target="_blank">Edit As New</a>

The page at <a href="http://www.alderg.com/github.html" target="_blank">www.alderg.com/github.html</a> does the I/O with GitHub and uses draw.io in embed mode for the editing. The page supports the following URL parameters: user, pass, repo, path, ref and action=open (the Edit link above is an example). Using action=open, links for immediate diagram editing in GitHub can be created (requires user and pass parameters). You can also use files on GitHub as templates in draw.io via the url parameter (see Edit As New above).

Supported file formats: .png, .svg, .html and .xml (default)
